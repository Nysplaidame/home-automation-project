# Sub-Project Prompt: Claude MCP AI Integration

## Context
Part of home automation project with fire safety focus. Provides advanced AI-driven automation through Claude's Model Context Protocol, enabling natural language control and intelligent emergency response coordination.

## System Overview
- **Platform:** Dedicated service (potentially separate VM)
- **Network:** VLAN 20 (Management) - Internet access required
- **Integration:** Deep Home Assistant integration via MCP protocol
- **Purpose:** Intelligent automation beyond traditional rule-based systems

## AI Capabilities
- **Natural Language Control:** Voice/text commands for complex automation
- **Emergency Response:** Intelligent fire safety coordination
- **Predictive Analysis:** Sensor data analysis for early warnings
- **Automation Logic:** Complex multi-system decision making
- **Learning:** Pattern recognition from sensor and usage data

## Integration Points
- **Home Assistant:** Primary integration via MCP protocol
- **PrintAirPipe:** Intelligent ventilation and safety decisions
- **CCTV System:** AI analysis of video feeds for anomaly detection
- **Network Monitoring:** Intelligent system health analysis
