## Board Settings

**Focus Constraint:** Max 2 items in "In Progress"  
**Priority Legend:**

- Critical: Safety systems, core infrastructure
- High: Primary functionality, major components
- Medium: Enhancements, maintenance
- Low: Advanced features, optimizations

**Board Rules:**

1. Safety-critical procedures take priority
2. Foundation procedures must complete before dependent items
3. All procedures require testing validation
4. Documentation updated on completion
