# OpenWrt VLAN Configuration - Placeholder
# Configuration for 4-VLAN setup will be added here


#
# Architecture Context: [[docs/decisions/001-network-architecture]]
# Network Design: 4-VLAN security-segmented architecture
# Project Status: [[Main/Home Automation/Readme]]
# Implementation: GL.iNet GL-MT6000 with OpenWrt

#
# VLAN Configuration Plan:
# - VLAN 10: Management (192.168.10.0/24) - Full internet access
# - VLAN 20: Automation (192.168.20.0/24) - Controlled internet (HA only)
# - VLAN 30: CCTV (192.168.30.0/24) - No internet, HA bridge access
# - VLAN 40: Storage (192.168.40.0/24) - No internet, Frigate access  
# - VLAN 50: IoT Sensors (192.168.50.0/24) - No internet, HA control (SAFETY CRITICAL)
#
# Critical Implementation Notes:
# - VLAN 50 must be completely isolated from internet for fire safety
# - Inter-VLAN rules defined in [[configs/openwrt/firewall-config.sh]]
# - Emergency access protocols included for fire safety override
