# Session: Repository Setup Complete - 2025-09-12

## Current State
- **Phase:** Network Architecture & Planning (25% complete)
- **System Focus:** Documentation structure setup and GitHub repository creation with Windows compatibility
- **Repository:** https://github.com/Nysplaidame/home-automation-project (active and synced)
- **Branch:** main
- **Status:** Complete repository structure created, pushed to GitHub, ready for OpenWrt router configuration implementation

## Key Decisions & Rationale
- **Modular Session-Based Documentation:** Large configs overwhelming Claude context vs. maintainable structure → External git storage for configs, Claude sessions for decisions/context → Separates large data files from decision reasoning, enables scalable project growth
- **Phase-Based Directory Structure:** Complex multi-system project organization challenge → Separate directories by system type and implementation phase → Matches project implementation timeline, improves navigation and reduces cognitive load
- **Windows-Compatible PowerShell Setup:** Initial bash script incompatible with Windows environment → Created native PowerShell version with complete Windows compatibility → Enables seamless repository initialization on user's Windows system without WSL requirements
- **Project Repository Name Change:** Original "home-automation-safety" vs. clarity → Renamed to "home-automation-project" for simplicity → Cleaner name, avoids potential conflicts, easier to reference in documentation and GitHub

## Session Accomplishments
- [x] Created scalable documentation structure supporting multi-phase complex automation project
- [x] Established comprehensive repository organization with logical folder hierarchy matching implementation phases
- [x] Implemented session state management system enabling Claude context persistence across interactions
- [x] Developed and tested PowerShell setup script for Windows environment compatibility
- [x] Successfully ran repository structure creation and verification scripts
- [x] Installed and configured Git for project version control with proper remote configuration
- [x] Created GitHub repository "home-automation-project" with appropriate settings and description
- [x] Completed initial push of entire project structure to GitHub with all documentation
- [x] Documented complete setup procedure for future reference and troubleshooting

## Technical State
- **Working Systems:** Complete repository structure operational on GitHub, all documentation files properly organised, Git workflow functional
- **Active Issues:** None - all Windows PowerShell compatibility issues resolved during session
- **Immediate Dependencies:** OpenWrt router firmware installation, VLAN configuration implementation, device MAC address inventory
- **Risk Factors:** Repository structure scaling needs monitoring as project grows, single point of failure if GitHub repository becomes unavailable

## Context for Next Session
- **Priority 1:** [[Main/home-automation-safety/docs/prompts/01-network-infrastructure-UPDATED|Implement OpenWrt router VLAN configuration]] per network architecture design
- **Priority 2:** [[Main/home-automation-safety/docs/procedures/Git Repository - Setup Procedure|Use established Git workflow]] for configuration file management
- **Priority 3:** [[Main/home-automation-safety/docs/prompts/03-printairpipe-ventilation|Research PrintAirPipe sensor models]] and procurement planning
- **Files to load:** [[Main/home-automation-safety/docs/decisions/001-network-architecture|Network Architecture Decision]], [[Main/home-automation-safety/docs/diagrams/Network Diagram|Network Topology]]
- **Context needed:** OpenWrt installation procedures, specific VLAN interface configuration syntax, firewall rule implementation

## Essential Resources
- **Architecture:** [[Main/home-automation-safety/docs/decisions/001-network-architecture|4-VLAN Network Architecture Decision]] - Implementation foundation
- **Configuration:** [[Main/home-automation-safety/docs/procedures/Git Repository - Setup Procedure|Git Repository Setup Procedure]] - Complete workflow documentation
- **External Resources:** 
  - PrintAirPipe Hardware STL: https://nerdiy.de/en/product-2/printairpipe-125-actuator-sensor-set-3d-printable-stl-files/
  - ESPHome Integration Code: https://github.com/Nerdiyde/ESPHomeSnippets/tree/c0135795dc180c6ff4a1306b2f5982ef3db386c3/Snippets/PrintAirPipe
- **Previous session:** [[Main/home-automation-safety/docs/session-states/session_state_20250909-concise|Initial Planning Session]]

## Critical Context (Cannot Lose)
**System Architecture:**
- **Repository Structure:** `docs/` (sessions, decisions, procedures, prompts, diagrams), `configs/` (openwrt, home-assistant, frigate, esphome, proxmox), `scripts/` (setup, backup, monitoring)
- **4-VLAN Network:** VLAN 20 (Automation, 192.168.20.0/24, Internet), VLAN 30 (CCTV, 192.168.30.0/24, No Internet, HA bridge), VLAN 40 (Storage, 192.168.40.0/24, No Internet, Frigate), VLAN 50 (IoT Sensors, 192.168.50.0/24, No Internet, HA only)

**Safety/Security Considerations:**
- All safety-critical configurations now version controlled and backed up in GitHub
- Network isolation design prevents external compromise of fire safety systems
- Repository serves as disaster recovery mechanism for entire system configuration

**Implementation Details:**
- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/Nysplaidame/home-automation-project (active, main branch)
- Local Development: PowerShell scripts for Windows environment, Git workflow established
- Session Management: Structured templates for maintaining Claude context across development sessions

**Business Logic:**
- Repository structure must scale to support all 7 sub-projects without reorganization
- Configuration files separated from documentation to prevent Claude context overflow
- Session states maintain decision reasoning independent of technical implementation files

## Implementation Progress Tracking
- **Completed Phases:** Project planning, network architecture, documentation structure, repository setup
- **Current Phase:** Repository operational, ready for network infrastructure implementation
- **Next Phase:** OpenWrt router configuration and VLAN implementation per architectural design
- **Blocked/Waiting:** Hardware procurement status (GL.iNet router, sensors), OpenWrt compatibility testing
