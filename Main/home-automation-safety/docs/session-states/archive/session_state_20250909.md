# Session State Save - Home Automation Project 09-09-25

## Session Navigation
- **Previous Session:** _This is the initial session_
- **Next Session:** [[session_state_20250912|Repository Setup Session]]
- **Project Overview:** [[main/home-automation-safety/README|Home Automation Project]]
- **Related Decision:** [[001-network-architecture|Network Architecture Decision]]

## Session Metadata
- **Date:** September 9, 2025
- **Session #:** 1
- **Duration:** ~2 hours
- **Claude Model:** Claude Sonnet 4

## Project Overview
- **Project Name:** Home Automation Fire Safety & CCTV System
- **Project Type:** IoT Hardware/Software Development with Safety Systems
- **Objective:** Create a comprehensive home automation system focused on fire safety and safe ventilation for 3D printing operations, with integrated CCTV monitoring and secure network architecture
- **Timeline:** Multi-month project with safety systems prioritized first

## Current Status

### Completed This Session
- [x] Created comprehensive project prompt defining system architecture
- [x] Designed 4-VLAN network topology with hybrid management approach
- [x] Developed OpenWrt firewall configuration for GL.iNet GL-MT6000 router
- [x] Integrated Bambu Labs P1S printer into safety system
- [x] Resolved remote CCTV access through secure Home Assistant bridging
- [x] Created network diagram showing device placement and data flows
- [x] Established security zones isolating critical safety systems from internet
- [x] Designed session state save template for project persistence

### Overall Progress
- **% Complete:** 15%
- **Current Phase:** Network Architecture & Planning
- **Key Milestones Reached:**
  - Network security architecture finalized
  - Device IP allocation scheme established
  - Firewall rules defined for all security zones
  - Remote access strategy confirmed (VPN + HA bridge)

## Key Decisions & Context

### Critical Decisions Made
1. **4-VLAN Hybrid Architecture:** Combined management and automation into single VLAN (20) to reduce complexity while maintaining security
2. **IoT Complete Isolation:** VLAN 50 (sensors/smart plugs) completely blocked from internet for maximum safety
3. **Remote Camera Access:** CCTV isolation maintained while enabling remote monitoring through Home Assistant bridge
4. **Bambu P1S Integration:** Printer placed in IoT VLAN with temporary setup rule for initial cloud login

### System Architecture
**4-VLAN network with security zones:**
- **VLAN 20:** Automation & Management (192.168.20.0/24) - Internet access
- **VLAN 30:** CCTV (192.168.30.0/24) - No internet, HA bridge access
- **VLAN 40:** Storage (192.168.40.0/24) - No internet, Frigate access
- **VLAN 50:** IoT Sensors (192.168.50.0/24) - No internet, HA control only

### Dependencies & Requirements
- GL.iNet GL-MT6000 router with OpenWrt
- MINIX Mini PC (i3-N350, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)
- Proxmox virtualization platform
- POE switch for cameras
- Raspberry Pi for NAS
- Various sensors and smart plugs
- WireGuard VPN for remote access

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Actions (Next Session)
1. Create VLAN interface configuration for OpenWrt
2. Design device inventory tracking system with MAC addresses
3. Research specific sensor models and Home Assistant integration methods
4. Plan Proxmox VM resource allocation and configuration

### Upcoming Priorities
- OpenWrt router setup and VLAN implementation
- Proxmox installation and VM deployment
- Home Assistant initial configuration and device discovery
- Sensor selection and procurement planning
- 3D printed ventilation system design

## Issues & Blockers

### Current Blockers
- Need to procure and test OpenWrt flash for GL-MT6000
- Sensor model selection requires research
- Power backup strategy undefined

### Known Issues
- Bambu P1S requires temporary internet access for initial setup
- Resource allocation for multiple VMs on single mini PC needs validation
- Emergency protocols and fail-safes need detailed design

### Risk Factors
- Fire safety system failure could result in property damage
- Network misconfiguration could compromise security isolation
- Single point of failure with one mini PC hosting critical services

## Architecture References & Implementation
- **Network Architecture:** [[001-network-architecture|4-VLAN design formalized from this session]]
- **Network Diagram:** [[Network Diagram|Visual network topology]]
- **Implementation Files:** Configuration files designed this session

## Created Artifacts & Documents
