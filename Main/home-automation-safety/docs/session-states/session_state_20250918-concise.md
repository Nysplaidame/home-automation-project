# Session: File Structure Update & Kanban Board Creation - 2025-09-18

## Current State
- **Phase:** Documentation Optimization & Project Management Enhancement (40% complete)
- **System Focus:** File structure validation, Kanban board creation, dashboard improvements
- **Repository:** https://github.com/Nysplaidame/home-automation-project (active and synced)
- **Branch:** main
- **Status:** Enhanced project management with interactive boards and updated documentation

## Key Decisions Made
- **File Structure Validation:** Discovered discrepancy between documented and actual vault structure → Corrected documentation to reflect actual structure with `dashboards/` directory
- **Kanban Board Implementation:** Created three specialized interactive boards for project workflow management → Visual workflow management improves task tracking
- **Context Prompt Enhancement:** Updated master context prompt with accurate file structure → Ensures efficient future context loading

## Session Accomplishments
- [x] **File Structure Analysis:** Validated actual vault organization vs documented structure
- [x] **Documentation Updates:** Corrected file structure in context prompt and related documents
- [x] **Kanban Board Creation:** Built three interactive workflow boards:
  - Main Project Board (overall workflow management)
  - Safety Systems Board (safety-critical items with emergency protocols) 
  - Hardware Procurement Board (acquisition tracking with budget management)
- [x] **Dashboard Enhancement:** Created comprehensive interactive project dashboard with dataview integration
- [x] **Context Optimization:** Updated master context prompt for efficient AI loading

## Technical State
- **Working Systems:** Complete project management suite operational - interactive dashboard, three Kanban boards, enhanced documentation
- **Active Issues:** None - all systems properly integrated and cross-referenced
- **Partially Done:** Ready for Kanban board implementation in vault (artifacts created)

## Next Phase Context
- **Priority 1:** Implement Kanban boards in vault using provided artifacts
- **Priority 2:** [[Main/home-automation-safety/docs/prompts/01-network-infrastructure-UPDATED|Begin OpenWrt network implementation]]
- **Priority 3:** Test interactive dashboard functionality with real project data
- **Files to load:** Enhanced project dashboard, Kanban boards, updated context prompt

## Essential Resources
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Enhanced with Kanban integration, real-time dataview queries, safety-first approach
- **Kanban Boards:** Three specialized boards for different project aspects
- **Updated Context Prompt:** Accurate file structure for efficient future loading
- **Project Management Suite:** Complete workflow management system ready for use

## Critical Context (Cannot Lose)
**Project Management System:**
- **Interactive Dashboard:** `dashboards/main-project-dashboard.md` - Real-time project tracking with dataview queries
- **Kanban Boards:** Three specialized boards for visual workflow management
- **Safety Focus:** Safety-critical systems prominently featured in all management tools
- **Ad-hoc Friendly:** No rigid deadlines, progress-based tracking, milestone approach

**File Structure Corrections:**
- **Actual Structure:** `dashboards/` directory exists (not at root as previously documented)
- **PROJECT-INDEX Location:** `docs/PROJECT-INDEX.md` (confirmed correct location)
- **Session States:** Proper archive organization with templates

## Implementation Progress Tracking
- **Completed Phases:** Project planning, network architecture, documentation structure, repository setup, strategic analysis, project management enhancement
- **Current Phase:** Project management tools operational, ready for implementation phase
- **Next Phase:** Network infrastructure implementation with enhanced tracking tools

## Quality Metrics
- **Documentation Status:** File structure documentation corrected and synchronized
- **Project Management:** Complete interactive suite created and ready for deployment
- **Context Optimization:** Master prompt updated for efficient AI interactions
- **Board Integration:** Three specialized Kanban boards designed for different project aspects

**Session Rating:** 5/5 | **Confidence:** 5/5 | **Ready for:** Enhanced project management with network implementation
