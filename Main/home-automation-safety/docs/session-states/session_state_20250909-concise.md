# Session: Initial Planning & Architecture - 2025-09-09

## Current State
- **Phase:** Initial Planning & Architecture (15% complete)
- **System Focus:** Network architecture and security design for home automation with fire safety
- **Repository:** Not yet created (repository setup planned for next session)
- **Branch:** N/A
- **Status:** 4-VLAN network architecture complete and documented, ready for implementation and repository setup

## Key Decisions & Rationale
- **4-VLAN Hybrid Architecture:** Single router complexity vs. security isolation → Combined management/automation into VLAN 20 → Reduces network complexity while maintaining essential security boundaries for safety systems
- **Complete IoT Internet Isolation:** Fire safety system internet access risk → VLAN 50 completely blocked from internet → Eliminates external attack vectors on safety-critical sensors and emergency shutoff systems  
- **Home Assistant CCTV Bridge:** Remote camera access vs. network isolation → Secure HA bridging for remote monitoring → Maintains CCTV network isolation while enabling authorized remote access through authenticated Home Assistant
- **Bambu P1S Temporary Setup Rule:** Printer cloud setup vs. IoT isolation → Temporary internet access rule for initial setup → Enables required cloud authentication while maintaining long-term isolation in IoT VLAN

## Session Accomplishments
- [x] Created comprehensive project architecture defining fire safety automation system with 4-VLAN security model
- [x] Designed network topology integrating Bambu Labs P1S printer into safety-critical monitoring system
- [x] Developed complete OpenWrt firewall configuration for GL.iNet GL-MT6000 router with security zone isolation
- [x] Resolved remote CCTV access challenge through secure Home Assistant bridge maintaining network isolation
- [x] Created detailed network diagram showing device placement, data flows, and security boundaries
- [x] Established IP allocation scheme and documented all device assignments for each VLAN
- [x] Defined emergency protocols and fail-safe mechanisms for fire safety system
- [x] Designed session state management system for maintaining project context across Claude interactions

## Technical State
- **Working Systems:** 4-VLAN security architecture fully designed, device IP allocation complete, firewall rules defined and documented
- **Active Issues:** GL.iNet GL-MT6000 OpenWrt compatibility needs verification, specific sensor model selection pending research
- **Immediate Dependencies:** OpenWrt router firmware installation, device inventory with MAC addresses, sensor procurement decisions
- **Risk Factors:** Single point of failure with MINIX Mini PC hosting critical services, fire safety system failure could result in property damage, network misconfiguration could compromise security isolation

## Context for Next Session
- **Priority 1:** [[Git Repository - Setup Procedure|Create GitHub repository and documentation structure]] for configuration management
- **Priority 2:** [[Main/home-automation-safety/docs/prompts/01-network-infrastructure-UPDATED|Begin OpenWrt router configuration]] with VLAN interface setup
- **Priority 3:** Research and select specific sensor models for [[03-printairpipe-ventilation|PrintAirPipe ventilation system]]
- **Files to load:** [[001-network-architecture|Network Architecture Decision]], [[Network Diagram|Network Topology Diagram]]
- **Context needed:** Repository structure requirements, OpenWrt installation procedures, sensor integration methods

## Essential Resources
- **Architecture:** [[001-network-architecture|4-VLAN Network Architecture Decision]] - Complete security model and rationale
- **Configuration:** [[Network Diagram|Network Topology Diagram]] - Visual device placement and data flows
- **External Resources:** GL.iNet GL-MT6000 OpenWrt documentation, Bambu Labs P1S API documentation
- **Previous session:** None (initial project session)

## Critical Context (Cannot Lose)
**System Architecture:**
- **VLAN 20:** Automation & Management (192.168.20.0/24) - Internet access, Home Assistant, Proxmox management
- **VLAN 30:** CCTV Surveillance (192.168.30.0/24) - No internet, HA bridge access only for remote monitoring
- **VLAN 40:** Storage & NVR (192.168.40.0/24) - No internet, Frigate NVR access from VLAN 30 only
- **VLAN 50:** IoT Sensors & Controls (192.168.50.0/24) - No internet, Home Assistant control only, safety-critical devices

**Safety/Security Considerations:**
- Fire safety system must operate independently of internet connectivity
- Emergency power cutoff capability required for 3D printer and ventilation
- Multiple sensor types needed: temperature, smoke detection, VOC monitoring
- Network isolation prevents external compromise of safety systems

**Implementation Details:**
- Router: GL.iNet GL-MT6000 with OpenWrt firmware
- Core System: MINIX NEO Z350-0dB fanless mini PC (i3-N350, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)
- Virtualization: Proxmox platform hosting Home Assistant, Frigate NVR, other services
- Network: POE switch for cameras, managed switch for VLAN support

**Business Logic:**
- Safety systems have absolute priority over convenience features
- All IoT devices must be isolated from internet access after initial setup
- Remote access only through WireGuard VPN and Home Assistant authentication
- Emergency protocols must function during network or power failures

## Implementation Progress Tracking
- **Completed Phases:** Project conceptualization, network architecture design, security model definition
- **Current Phase:** Network architecture documentation complete, ready for repository setup
- **Next Phase:** Repository creation and OpenWrt router implementation
- **Blocked/Waiting:** Hardware procurement (router, sensors), OpenWrt compatibility verification

## Quality Metrics
- **Documentation Status:** Network architecture fully documented with rationale, visual diagrams created
- **Test Coverage:** Design validated through security threat modeling, no physical testing yet
- **Technical Debt:** None - comprehensive planning phase with no shortcuts taken
